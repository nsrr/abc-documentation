# About

The Apnea, Bariatric surgery, and CPAP (ABC) study aimed to assess the role of bariatric (weight loss) surgery as compared to continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) therapy plus weight loss counseling for the treatment of patients with class II obesity and those who have severe obstructive sleep apnea (OSA).
