# About

The Apnea, Bariatric surgery, and CPAP (ABC) study aimed to assess the role of bariatric (weight loss) surgery as compared to continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) therapy plus weight loss counseling for the treatment of patients with class II obesity and those who have severe obstructive sleep apnea (OSA).

## Methods

## PSG Collection
PSG signal data were collected using the Compumedics E-Series system (Abbotsford, Victoria, Australia). EDF signal and XML signals were later exported from the Compumedics E-Series system.

1. EDF - Signal files in the European Data Format exported from Compumedics Profusion.
2. XML (Profusion) - Annotation files exported from Compumedics Profusion. (Learn more...)
3. XML (NSRR) - Annotation files processed in the EDF Editor and Translator tool.
